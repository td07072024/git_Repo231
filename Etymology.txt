The name "hamster" is a loanword from the German, which itself derives from earlier Middle High German hamastra. It is possibly related to Old Church Slavonic khomestoru, which is either a blend of the root of Russian хомяк (khomyak) "hamster" and a Baltic word (cf. Lithuanian: staras "hamster");[10] or of Persian origin (cf. Avestan: hamaēstar "oppressor").[11] The collective noun for a group of hamsters is "horde".[12] In German, the verb hamstern is derived from Hamster. It means "to hoard".
